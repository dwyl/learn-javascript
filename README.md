This post (book?) is a work-in-progess (labour of love) which I have been 
planning for 5 years and have notes for in various paper/online notebooks.
I decided to follow Addy Osmani's example and *write* this on GitHub.

His book **Learning JavaScript Design Patterns** (see below) is shared

Learning JavaScript is no longer *optional* for people that want to build
amazing web sites, apps & experiences. But getting started can be daunting.
A quick 
[search for JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=javascript) 
on Amazon yields over *five thousand results*! Mercifully you do not have 
to be overwhelmed by the ocean of books/tutorials/videos!

Unlike most of my colleagues I am not a (*formally* trained) Computer Scientist
or "Software Engineer", I created my own curriculum and learned by doing.
To a non-programmer it might look like I *bluffed* my way into getting paid
to write code, but that could not be *further* from the truth. 
With enough dedication, coding is something *anyone* can learn.

# Where do I Start?!

## Option 1

Read a *shelf* of books to acquire the knowledge of *expert* developers.

Here are 11 I have learned a lot from and *recommend*:

Since JavaScript does not operate in isolation in the Web Browser,
you will need to have some **Basic HTML & CSS** knowledge to get started:

- Basics of Web Design: HTML5 and CSS3 (Terry Felke-Morris 
2011 - **368** pages)
http://www.amazon.com/Basics-Web-Design-HTML5-CSS3/dp/0137003382/

![Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3](http://www-fp.pearsonhighered.com/coverimage/0133128911.jpg "Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3")

After you know a bit of HTML & CSS 
Keith & Sambells (2010) will give you a *gentle* and interesting introduction 
to the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use JavaScript in the browser:

- DOM Scripting: Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model (Jeremy Keith & Jeffrey Sambells 2010 - **336** pages)
http://www.amazon.com/DOM-Scripting-Design-JavaScript-Document/dp/1430233893/

![DOM Scripting](http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9781430233893_p0_v2_s260x420.JPG "DOM Scripting")

Once you have some foundational web development skills you can pick a book
that is *focussed* on learning JavaScript with plenty of tutorials:

- Javascript for **Beginners** (Mark Lassoff 2013 - **292** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Javascript-Beginners-Mr-Mark-Lassoff/dp/0988842955/

![Javascript for Beginners](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B0LwpmLqL._SY344_PJlook-inside-v2,TopRight,1,0_SH20_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg "Javascript for Beginners")

Once you have learned basics you need to focus on "**The Good Parts**":

- JavaScript **The Good Parts** (Douglas Crockford 2008 - **147** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/

![JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/javascript_the_good_parts.jpg "JavaScript: The Good Parts")

Once you have *mastered* the **Good Parts**, begin to *hone* your **craft**
by learning the correct "**Patterns**" for writing efficient code:

- JavaScript **Patterns** (Stoyan Stefanov 2010 - **236** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/

![JavaScript Patterns](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/javascript_patterns.jpg "JavaScript Patterns")

- Learning JavaScript **Design Patterns** (Andy Osmani 2012 - **254** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Design-Patterns-Osmani/dp/1449331815/

![Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/learning_javascript_design_patterns.jpg "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns")

Now that you know the language *patterns* 
its time for **Test Driven Development** (TDD):

- **Test-Driven** JavaScript Development (Christian Johansen, 2010 - **600** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-JavaScript-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0321683919/

![Test-Driven JavaScript Development](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/10/test-driven_javascript_development.jpg "Test-Driven JavaScript Development")

- **Testable** JavaScript (Mark Ethan Trostler 2013 - **274** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/

![Testable JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/testable_javascript.jpg "Testable JavaScript")

And if you plan on working in a **team** of more than **one** person, 
you will need to ensure your code is **maintainable**:

- Maintainable JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010 - **242** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/

![Maintainable JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/maintainable_javascript.jpg "Maintainable JavaScript")

Now you are getting quite good at but your JS code is still not *performing*
like *Google*'s ...

- **High Performance** JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010 - **242** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Performance-JavaScript-Faster-Application-Interfaces/dp/059680279X/

![High Performance JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/high_performance_javascript.jpg "High Performance JavaScript")

You're feeling pretty *confident* in your JS skills you want to take it to
"**Ninja**" Level:

- Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja (John Resig 2012 - **392** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X/

**3303 pages**. If you read a page every 2 minutes 
(bear in mind that this is *code* you need to *understand* because 
later chapters build upon the knowledge so you *cannot skim-read* it...)  
it would take **6600 Minutes** or **110 Hours**.
You could do that in a couple of weeks, *right*...? ;-)
No! Reading an hour a day it would take you **3.5 months** 
(if you didn't skip any days)...

What if someone condensed all that knowledge into a 
**Simple Series of Step-by-Step
Interactive Online Tutorials** ...?

### Introduction

The *Preface* of **JavaScript The Good Parts** (Crockford, 2008) 
*explicitly* says: 

> This is **not** a book **for beginners** ...
> This is **not** a book for **dummies**.

[Douglas Crockford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) 
is the Grandfather of JavaScript. 
He poineered using JS for web *application* development in the 90's,
was the Cheif of JS @Yahoo and is now the "*architect*" @PayPal.
While Crockford is an *authority* on JS he makes no 
attempt to teach *beginners*. This is a tragegy which I intend to remedy.

Watch Crockford's Intro to JS: http://youtu.be/v2ifWcnQs6M
its a *fantastic* video if you *already* have programming *experience*,
but for people *without* a CS Degree it uses *way* 
**too many technical terms**.

A few of Douglas **Crockford**'s *best* videos:
- JavaScript: Your New Overload: http://youtu.be/Trurfqh_6fQ
- JavaScript: Really. JavaScript: http://youtu.be/lTWGoL1N-Kc


### Nothing to "Install" or "Configure"

One of the most compelling features of JavaScript is that it runs in browsers!


### Basic Data Types

#### Variables

![Storage](http://i.imgur.com/NOytTum.jpg "Storage")

Variables let us (*temporarily*) **store information** so we can access 
("retrieve") it later. We create a variable using the **var** keyword:

```javascript
var favoriteColor = "green";  // quotation marks indicate this is a "String"
console.log("My Favorite Color is: "+favoriteColor);
```
Try: http://repl.it/M3D

Here we are creating a *variable* called **favoriteColor** and *assign*
it the *value* of "**green**". Later we can use this variable in a 
**console.log()** to dispaly a message on the JavaScript console.

##### What Should I *Call* My Variable?

The general rule with variable names is: be descriptive and consistent.

+ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4743730/what-is-console-log-and-how-do-i-use-it


#### Boolean

![True or False](http://i.imgur.com/MZqkRuO.jpg "True or False")

A boolean value can either be **true** or **false**. 

```javascript
/*jslint browser: true, devel: true */
var asleep = true; // notice there are no quotation marks for true/false

if (asleep === true) {
    console.log("I'm very tired, please do not wake me!");
} else {
    console.log("Wide awake, lets write some code!");
}
```
Try: http://repl.it/M3K

An example of how/where we use a boolean value in "real" code:

```javascript
var connected = true;   // if our user is connected to the internet

if(connected === true) {
	sendDataToServer(); // Send data to server for processing/saving/sharing
} else {
	saveDataLocally();  // Keep data on local machine
}
```

##### Truthy & Falsy ... What?!

In JavaScript the following values are described as ***falsy***:
- **false**
- empty string ("")
- **null**
- **undefined**
- **NaN** (which means Not-a-Number!)
- **+0** & **−0** (Zero)

By contrast *everything else* is considered "***truthy***".
If in doubt use the tripple-equals comparison **===** sign to compare
two values and confirm if a variable is truthy or falsey.

- *Sitepoint* truthy/falsy article: http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/


#### Strings

Strings are text (characters *stringed* together). 
In javascript we use double-quotes when creating ("*declaring*") a string.

```javascript
var myString = "Any text inside quotes is a string we can re-use later!";
console.log(myString); // simply displays the myString on the JS console
```
Try: http://repl.it/M4E

##### Read More
- More about ***Strings** than you will *ever* need to know: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)

- Using single quote character ' for strings is frowned upon by 
experienced JS developers because they are easily confused with apostrphe or
backticks. see: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/characters/

#### Numbers

JavaScript only has one type of number. 1 and 1.0 are considered equal.

```javascript
var a = 1,
    b = 1.0;
console.log(a === b); // true
```
Try: http://repl.it/MrW

Numbers allow us to do Math!

```javascript
var a = 1,
    b = 2,
    c = a + b;
console.log(c); // 3
```
Try: http://repl.it/MrY

We will dive into the **Math** library later on.
If you can't wait, read:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math

#### Arrays

Arrays allow us to create a *list* of items.
We create a new array using the *square brackets* **[ ]**
e.g:
```javascript
var myArray = []
console.log("My Array has "+myArray.length +" items in it!");
```
Try: http://repl.it/Mr0

Somewhat confusingly (though you will soon get used to it) arrays are 
[*zero-indexed*]() this means that to access the *first* item
in an array we use `myArray[0]`

e.g:

```javascript
var weekDays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
console.log(weekDays[0] +" is the first weekday!"); // Monday is the first weekday!
```
Try: http://repl.it/Mr1

There are many **built-in methods** we can use with arrays. 

#### Objects

#### Null

#### Undefined

### Functions



### Test *First* Development

One of my biggest gripes with *all* the "Beginners" JavaScript Books I've read
is that they either don't cover testing *at all* or have an *afterthought* 
chapter towards the end of the book like 

> oh, and there's this thing called "*testing*" which you really should do...

Meanwhile most books teach you a heap of **bad habits** which are very 
difficult to correct later on.

## Research

### Existing Online Learning Tools

#### Try Ruby > Code School

The original TryRuby online tutorials (available at:
http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0 ) are *superb*!
If I was to chose an online code learing series TryRuby.org would be it!

From the same team: https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript

Naturally I signed up to codeschool and completed **all** the JS tutorials.


#### Scripty Books = Interactive Tutorials (*Paid*)

This past year I have spent a great deal of time learning Front-end 
([MVC/MVVM](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/667781/what-is-the-difference-between-mvc-and-mvvm))
frameworks (e.g: Angluar, Ember, Knockout and Backbone) 
while learning Backbone.js I cam across: ScriptyBooks:
http://www.scriptybooks.com/books/backbone-coffeescript/chapters/quick-tour
*paid* the $18 and did the interactive tutorials.
As good as the Scripty system is I found it lacking in a few key areas:

- **No** ***Offline*** Use (had to be on the website for it to work!)
- Difficult to bit-size the learning (if you only have 2 mins)
